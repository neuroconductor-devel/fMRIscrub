#' Projection scrubbing
#' 
#' Projection scrubbing is a data-driven method for identifying artifact-contaminated
#'  volumes in fMRI. It works by identifying component 
#'  directions in the data likely to represent patterns of burst noise, and then computing a 
#'  composite measure of outlyingness based on leverage within these directions, 
#'  at each volume. The projection can be PCA, ICA, or "fused PCA."
#'  Projection scrubbing can also be used for other outlier detection tasks involving 
#'  high-dimensional data.
#' 
#'  Refer to the projection scrubbing vignette for a demonstration and an
#'  outline of the algorithm: \code{vignette("projection_scrubbing", package="fMRIscrub")}

#' @inheritParams pscrub_Params
#' @param projection One of the following: \code{"ICA"} (default) or \code{"PCA"}.
#  or \code{"fusedPCA"}.
# @param R_true The \eqn{T} by \eqn{T} correlation matrix, if known. Used for the bootstrap
#  robust distance measure.
#' @param PESEL Use \code{\link[pesel]{pesel}} to select the number of 
#'  components? Default: \code{TRUE}. Otherwise, use the number of principal
#'  components with above-average variance.
#' @return A \code{"pscrub"} object, i.e. a list with components
