`fMRIscrub` is a collection of routines for data-driven scrubbing (projection scrubbing and DVARS), motion scrubbing, and other fMRI denoising strategies such as anatomical CompCor, detrending, and nuisance regression. Projection scrubbing is also applicable to other outlier detection tasks involving high-dimensional data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of fMRIscrub from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mandymejia/fMRIscrub")
```

## Quick start guide

``` r
s_Dat1 <- scrub(Dat1)
plot(s_Dat1)
Dat1_cleaned <- Dat1[!s_Dat1$outlier_flag,]
```

## Data

Two scans from the [ABIDE I](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/abide_I.html) are included in `fMRIscrub`: `Dat1` has many artifacts whereas `Dat2` has few visible artifacts. Both are vectorized sagittal slices stored as numeric matrices. They are loaded into the environment upon loading the package.

We acknowledge the corresponding funding for the ABIDE I data:

> Primary support for the work by Adriana Di Martino was provided by the (NIMH K23MH087770) and the Leon Levy Foundation.
Primary support for the work by Michael P. Milham and the INDI team was provided by gifts from Joseph P. Healy and the Stavros Niarchos Foundation to the Child Mind Institute, as well as by an NIMH award to MPM ( NIMH R03MH096321).

## Citation

If using projection scrubbing, you can cite our 2023 paper ["Less is more: balancing noise reduction and data retention in fMRI with data-driven scrubbing"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2023.119972). In the Methods section there is also a description of how FD and DVARS are calculated (section 2.2), and how scrubbing can be implemented in a simultaneous nuisance regression framework (section 2.3.3).
